# Getting Started

If you are already a Python user, you will have no trouble using this tool.
All you need to do is to make sure your environment fulfills the [requirements](#module-requirements) and you're good to go.

However, for those less experienced with `Python`, the following sections explain how you can get your setup up and running.

## Installation

In this open-source repository, I am sharing the source code that implements the tool.
Thus, there is no installation package required to use it.

If you don't have it already, all you need to do is to
  1. Download the source code by cloning the repository or pressing the `Code` -> `Download ZIP` buttons and extracting the files into a directory of your choice.
  2. [Install `Python`](#python-installation) in your machine
  3. Install the [required modules](#module-requirements)
  4. [Launch the tool](#launch-the-tool) from the terminal

The following sections explain how to do each of these steps
